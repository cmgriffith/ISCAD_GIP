1. does femm.mi_analyze(0) save the solution to file?
2. path saves as tuple <path = (directory, filename)> DONE
3. load .json from working directory DONE
4. yoke inner lower BC assingment broken? DONE
5. clean up slot drawing "slot dimension mismatch!"
6. save FEMM files to subdirectory DONE
7. consolidate .JSON parent and python files

BUG why does "femm.mi_setcurrent(str(0),Aph)" not work for ONLY str(0)

8. make FEMM main inductance account for pole number?!
9. Analytical plots outputs DONE

compute inductances for rotating rotor, for rotation across a full slot pitch
