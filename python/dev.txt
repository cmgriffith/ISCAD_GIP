Q. mutual inductance integral definition & "coils". Conventionally mutual inductance is comprised of 
2 parts, integral of inward and outward currents. An ISCAD coil is a slot, so only 1 integral?

### XX.12.25

1. does femm.mi_analyze(0) save the solution to file?
2. DONE path saves as tuple <path = (directory, filename)>
3. DONE load .json from working directory
4. DONE yoke inner lower BC assingment broken?
5. clean up slot drawing "slot dimension mismatch!"
6. DONE save FEMM files to subdirectory
7. consolidate .JSON parent and python files, import from parent directy using OS?
8. make FEMM main inductance account for pole number?!
9. DONE Analytical plots outputs
10. compute inductances for rotating rotor, for rotation across a full slot pitch

BUG why does "femm.mi_setcurrent(str(0),Aph)" not work for ONLY str(0)

### 08.02.26

1. begin script for 3 slot linear load model, parametric and with/without NC conductors in proximity

### 10.02.26

1. DONE FEMM autoclose fix in windows 
2. DONE fixed derived_params() to handle non-existent params when different .JSON opened
3. DONE change subprocess (Linux/Win path compatibility problems) to an import for Analytical code, can import anywhere in script.
4. save plots to folder
5. add datetime to file saves
6. 3slot PRIORITY
