Q. mutual inductance integral definition & "coils". Conventionally mutual inductance is comprised of 
2 parts, integral of inward and outward currents. An ISCAD coil is a slot, so only 1 integral?
....

Code Refactor:
- ISCAD main file, call on analytical, FEMM, plots etc...

Plots:
- subplot implementation
- markers DONE
- grid DONE
- figure1 ? axis1?

### 30.12.25 
1. Include “p” pole parameter in currents() function 
2. After solve, save data to file 
3. Fix airgap B function 
4. Airgap B DFT function 
5. Initial plot functions 
6. Curved slots 

### XX.12.25
1. does femm.mi_analyze(0) save the solution to file?
2. DONE path saves as tuple <path = (directory, filename)>
3. DONE load .json from working directory
4. DONE yoke inner lower BC assingment broken?
5. clean up slot drawing "slot dimension mismatch!"
6. DONE save FEMM files to subdirectory
7. consolidate .JSON parent and python files, import from parent directy using OS?
8. make FEMM main inductance account for pole number?!
9. DONE Analytical plots outputs
10. compute inductances for rotating rotor, for rotation across a full slot pitch
BUG why does "femm.mi_setcurrent(str(0),Aph)" not work for ONLY str(0)

### 08.02.26
1. begin script for 3 slot linear load model, parametric and with/without NC conductors in proximity

### 10.02.26
1. DONE FEMM autoclose fix in windows 
2. DONE fixed derived_params() to handle non-existent params when different .JSON opened
3. DONE change subprocess (Linux/Win path compatibility problems) to an import for Analytical code, can import anywhere in script.
4. save plots to folder
5. add datetime to file saves
6. 3slot first results

### 11.02.26
1. continue 3slot parametric coding

### 12.02.26
1. adapt gap_slot to be built from Qm and gap_mut only DONE
2. fix iron boundary drawing DONE
3. fix mut slot drawing for h_mut < h_slot condition DONE
3. implement IABC instead of A=0 DONE
4. compute induvidual slot inductances (account for asymmetry) DONE
5. add glue line (0.05mm?) at joins?
